#  AquaSentinel â€“ Solution Overview

##  Problem
- Water leakage in residential pipelines is hard to detect until it causes real damage.
- Most systems can't reach inside the pipes to detect leaks early.
- Leads to water waste and infrastructure damage.

##  Proposed Solution
- A compact rover travels *inside* water pipelines in buildings.
- It detects leakage using:
  - Moisture Sensors
  - Flow Sensors
  - Ultrasonic Sensors
- Sends real-time alerts via Wi-Fi
- Controlled using Arduino IoT / custom app

##  Tech Stack
- ESP8266 Wi-Fi Module (NodeMCU)
- YL-69 Moisture Sensor
- YF-S201 Flow Sensor
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
- 3D printed frame / PVC body
- Mini motor and wheels
- Optional ESP32-CAM for visual detection

##  Target Outcome
- Reduce unnoticed water leakage
- Help conserve water in urban buildings
- Support SDG goals: Clean Water, Sustainable Cities
