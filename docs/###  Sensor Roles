###  Sensor Roles

- **Moisture Sensor (YL-69):**  
  Detects presence of water outside the inner wall of the pipeline â€” early leakage marker.

- **Flow Sensor (YF-S201):**  
  Tracks abnormal drop in flow rate indicating internal leakage or cracks.

- **Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04):**  
  Helps the rover avoid collisions and map the internal diameter for leak-spotting.

- **ESP32-CAM (Optional):**  
  Visual confirmation for suspected leak zones or deep inspection.
