# AquaSentinel – Smart Water Leakage Detection Rover

###  Problem Statement
Detecting water leakage inside pipelines of buildings and flats is difficult, leading to major water loss and structural damage.

###  Our Solution
AquaSentinel is a mini pipe-navigating rover that moves through pipelines and detects leakage using:
- Moisture Sensor (YL-69)
- Water Flow Sensor
- Ultrasonic Sensor
- Camera Module

It sends real-time data using ESP8266, helping building owners take early action to conserve water.

### ⚙ Components
- ESP8266 NodeMCU
- YL-69 Moisture Sensor
- YF-S201 Water Flow Sensor
- Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
- 3D printed or compact body
- Li-ion battery
- ESP32-CAM
